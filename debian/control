Description: Client library for operating OpenStack clouds
 Shade is a simple Python client library for operating OpenStack
 clouds. The key word here is simple. Clouds can do many things - but
 there are probably only about 10 of them that most people care about
 with any regularity. If you want to do complicated things, you should
 probably use the lower level client libraries - or even the REST API
 directly. However, if what you want is to be able to write an application
 that talks to clouds no matter what choices the deployer has made then
 shade is for you.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
